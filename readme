#Parramatta Light Rail Project
This project simulates and manages the operations of the Parramatta Light Rail system. It includes features for trip planning, passenger data management, tram deployment details, and timetable generation.

Features
main.py
The main script includes the following features:

Trip Planner: Helps users plan their trips by suggesting the best trams based on their input time and location.
Passenger Data Management: Manages data related to passenger boarding and onboard details.
Tram Deployment Details: Provides information about tram deployment and scheduling.
Partial Timetable Generation: Generates partial timetables based on specific criteria.
Full Timetable Generation: Generates comprehensive timetables for the entire tram network.
